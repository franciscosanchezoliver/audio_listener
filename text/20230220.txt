16:30:57;old and things like that song as a result of my favorites so maybe
16:31:04;a little bit of frog and success we're going to have all day time yesterday or maybe not
16:31:08;cancel the whole data is interested we cannot take up the story right to just monitoring
16:31:12;this is completed 400% we cannot pick up any of the tasks in the story right
16:31:15;maybe we can we can split the second point which is a thought enter
16:31:21;Alaska all enjoy separate user story but it has to be performed after the finish line of current injection
16:31:26;all the test and last one and this is maybe it will take more time that that one
16:31:29;no this is the first part let's see if we can accomplish in one spring but maybe it depends
16:31:34;I'm not sure if the previous one will be finished with new spring in this case if I think I think is the case and then
16:31:39;yeah because if it is not to repeat it for your screen probably we have to do that for the next one so then we should move that for the next one
16:31:44;I'm not sure if that because we never use task and then I think probably is better to keep them way of work and break the user history
16:31:48;if you have a development interesting together then it's better to keep both of them
16:31:51;in the same story and the if you see that there's some validation pending then you can get the story for that in the next
16:32:00;Tunes both of them would be working together I think it's all technicians can create
16:32:10;okay but then maybe it's better to keep only one
16:32:19;you mean because we have already one graded validation that is completed you you want to create the test there or
16:32:29;behind the dust that the half graded
16:32:41;digital validation of property in English we can have a validation as part of these two stories only and increase the story points
16:32:48;and then yeah yeah I guess yeah it's a it's you prefer work like this one and yeah we can create the best behind
16:33:11;I'm so distant
16:33:21;including girl weaknesses starts of how many story points Hollywood
16:33:31;if I would be nothing
16:33:39;Indian games
16:33:50;it is better Edition as part of the story only
16:33:59;the sun is that we are fixing anything
16:34:22;Karen Brad said that because there is one modification of the Quran mapping and there's one implementation on top because maybe in the implementation
16:34:30;this is where the fix right or not
16:37:49;not that I am over
16:37:58;okay I'll just review the stories and
16:38:09;future thing we need to add any new stories and feel free to ask we will discuss on them during our planning
16:38:19;okay anything else
16:38:30;okay then thank everyone have a good day thank you bye have a nice day thank you
